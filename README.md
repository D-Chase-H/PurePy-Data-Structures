CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

Pure Python Data Structures

Development Stage: Pre-Alpha

DISCLAIMER: Some of these data structures are undergoing a major re-work, that will greatly increase efficiency. I strongly reccommend that you wait until I finish my major re-wrok for a data structure before you use it. I will give each data structure it's own readme with a description of the data structure and what each method does. So, if a data structure's folder has it's own readme, then it's had it's re-work.


All Data Structures were made by me, by reading about the concept of the data structures and implementing them in the way I understood it. 
This means that no code here was taken from any guide or tutorial in any way. 

If it looks similair to code you've seen somewhere else, however unlikely that may be, it is probably due to the fact that with some 
things in data structures there's really only onee intuitive way to do things. I doubt there are any similairities with other peoples 
code, however if there are, feel free to point it out(in a nice way), because I would be interested to take a look at thier code and see 
if there is anything I can learn from it!

This is the initial Readme, just so I can start uploading files and get what I do have on my hard drive onto GitHub.

On off chance you are reading this before I make a real readme....

Another DISCLAIMER: 
    This readme WILL be changed soon, this is just the initial upload.
    Right now a few of the Data Structures I have made need some polish, and a most in the trees sub-folder are empty, but I wanted to get 
    this repository started, so there WILL be changes and clone the repo at your own risk.
