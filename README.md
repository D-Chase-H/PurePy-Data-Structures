Pure Python Data Structures

This is the initial Readme, just so I can start uploading files and get what I do have on my hard drive onto GitHub.

By th eoff chance if you are reading this before I make a real readme, DISCLAIMER this readme WILL be changed soon, but this is the initial upload.

Right now a few of the Data Structures I have made need some polish, and a most in the trees sub-folder are empty, but I wanted to get this repository started, so there WILL be changes and clone the repo at your own risk.
